        <p class="para">I am Seneca Cherry. I was born in New Orleans and was adopted when I was three by two women. I have traveled to two different countries and to most of the states. I love music and try to go to a concert every month. My favorite artists are Bassnectar and Ganja White Night. In fact, Bassnectar's music brought me and the love of my life together!</p>
        <p class="para">I crave challenges. I love trying to think in different ways and tackle the problem. The feeling of finding the solution makes you feel like a superhero. I went to school studying Criminal Justice and got a job as  paralegal for two private attorney's for two years. Towards my last year in school I started to realize I wasnt really into it so I chose to take a year hiatus to just work and live life, see what happens type of thing. I was going to follow my path and choose the next adventure or challenge that came along. One day I woke up and thought "coding would be cool." I looked into it and all the doors it could open and I got really excited so I made a plan and went for it. Now I am currently attending a program at DU and working towards completing my goal, which is ultimately being my own boss. </p>
